# Sponsorin

Sponsorin is an innovative application designed to help small and medium-sized Event Organizers (EO) in Indonesia find sponsors quickly and efficiently.

- **Sponsor Matching**: Find sponsors that align with your event through keyword-based matching.
- **Event Management**: Easily upload and manage event details.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Connect with sponsors directly for proposal approval and event support.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for real-time database, Firebase Authentication)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT API for generating proposals
- **Project Management**: Notion for task management, GitHub for version control
